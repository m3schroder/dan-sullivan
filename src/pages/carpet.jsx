            Our knowledge base is continually expanding and as we improve our
            residential carpet cleaning company on multiple levels, Here's some
            nifty tips on How to Clean Carpet:
            <div className="line-break" /> 1. Remove all loose dirt and debris
            2.Use a vacuuming machine to uplift and suck up dirt fro the floor.
            <div className="line-break" />
            There are many different types of vacuums out there. We don't really
            recommend one over the other right now. Our motto is: "Get one that
            works" . <div className="line-break" />
            Some Franklin home owners may find it best to own a dyson, while
            others are just fine with a nice sturdy Kenmore or Shark.
            <div className="line-break" /> We use multiple vacuums depending on
            the need of the home and the request of the home owner who wants a
            clean home.
            <div className="line-break" /> As you approach the higher end
            vacuums you may get higher suction and more features, such as air
            filtration to help with allergy and asthma sufferers.
